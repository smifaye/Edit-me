# Edit-me

Take any page from Citizens Advice or AdviserNet and put it into edit mode. This works for either Contentful or EPiServer. You can also view the cab-id for pages served from EPiServer.

When content designers are working on the Citizens Advice websites, they need to change the address from www.citizensadvice.org.uk to edit.citizensadvice.org.uk. This Chrome extension makes this much easier to do that.
